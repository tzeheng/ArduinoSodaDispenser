# Arduino Soda Dispenser
*January 24, 2019 -- Tze Heng Tan*  
This repository will contain the design specification, documentation and codes for Julius' soda dispenser. To be made out of cardboard, hotglue and controlled by an Arduino Uno controller 
## Overview
### Problem
1. **YouTube nerds**: Countless YouTube videos and channels constantly supplying Julius with nerdy ideas of things to make, such as this [soda dispenser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0ERi0Bt8Gk).
2. **Automation is a must**: A 'manual' [dispenser such as this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek0GqIr99X8) isn't enough. It has to be a *robot* (automatic).
3. **Daily SCRUMs**: The project manager, Julius, organized daily SCRUM and demands constant updates and progress reports.
> Are you finally fixing my cola machine?  
> Can you put lights and buttons on it now?  
> When will it be done?  
### Goals
1. Design and create a structure strong enough to hold the beverage, dispensing mechanism and electronics out of cardboard.
2. Design and approval of dispensing mechanism
3. Programming and testing of the dispensing mechanism
4. Deliver product on time before the enthusiasm runs out
### Out of scope
1. Decision on how the components will be reused for future projects
2. Product lifecycle management
3. Warranty of any kind
### People and roles
* **JJ - Project manager**: Oversight and approval of progress and projects
* **CW - Mechanical engineer**: Design and manufacture of the housing unit
* **TT - Control and operations**: Everything else
